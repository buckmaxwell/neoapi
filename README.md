# NeoAPI - the perfect tool for building python APIs with neo4j


What you can do:
 
 * Create powerful APIs that conform to the json api specification in minutes
 * Leverage the power of the neomodel OGM and py2neo to create beautiful models with great functionality.
 

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install neoapi
```
Thats all!

## Getting Started

To get started with NeoAPI it makes sense to familiarize yourself with 
[NeoModel](http://neomodel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [the json api specification](http://jsonapi.org/). These are the two technologies NeoAPI is built on.  

Chances are though, you want to get started right now!! If that's the case, please check out our [sample project](https://github.com/buckmaxwell/sample-neo-api), and Overview.md.  Together those resources should be the jetpack you need.

If you get stuck, do the reading I suggested above, or drop me an email at maxbuckdeveloper@gmail.com, I'm always happy
to help.
